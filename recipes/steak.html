    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Make sure your steaks are completely thawed. Remove them from the fridge and allow them to sit outside fridge for AT LEAST 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Put a pan over medium-high heat. Season thawed steaks with a good amount of large grain salt (sea salt) and ground pepper, rub bottom of steaks with excess salt and pepper that has fallen onto table.</li>
      <li>Once pan begins to smoke drop 1-2 Tbsp of olive oil in and coat pan in it. Lay steaks away from you into pan and let sear for one minute on each side. There should be three sides you sear (top, bottom, and fat side). Render the fat throughout all the cooking.</li>
      <li>Crush some fresh garlic, pinch off some fresh thyme, grab another Tbsp of olive oil and add it to pan around steaks while continuing to turn the steaks every minute.</li>
      <li>Add 2 Tbsp of butter to hot pan and baste the steaks by scooping melted butter on top of the cooking steaks.</li>
      <li>Continue basting and turning steaks on the minute until steak is at desired tenderness! Brush steaks with garlic. Remove from heat and place on cutting board and let rest 5-10 minutes, serve and enjoy the ultimate <strong>Steak!</strong></li>
    </ol>
